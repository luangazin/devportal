# Welcome to Platform devportal!

Congratulations on successfully deploying your application using Helm! Here are some important notes and information to help you get started:

## Application Versions
- Chart version: {{.Chart.Version}}
- App version: {{.Chart.AppVersion}}

## Application Access
- To access your application, use the following URL: {{ .Values.appConfig.app.baseUrl }}

## Configuration
- The Helm chart allows you to customize various aspects of your application's deployment. You can find the configuration values in the `values.yaml` file within the chart.
- To modify the configuration, you can either pass the values directly during installation or use a separate `values.yaml` file.
- Make sure to review and adjust the configuration according to your requirements before deploying.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues or need assistance, refer to the application's documentation or reach out to our support team at support@yourcompany.com.
- You can also check the application and deployment logs using the following command: `kubectl logs -f <pod-name>`
